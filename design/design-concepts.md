Design Concepts

My overall concept is that I want the site to be simple and elegant. I want all of the content to be centered in the page like a "postage-stamp" style site and to have clear sectioning with pretty images. I really liked all the floral design concepts that I looked at on Zen Garden, and want to add some floral or nature images of my own, and try to keep the color palette soft. I find that I usually go toward bold colors and loud themes, so I wanted to stretch myself and give the site a softer look. Plus when I hear "zen" I think calming. I want this site to be beautiful, but also useful.  

I want to provide my users with a soothing effect while they look at the CSS Zen Garden information. I think this will help them ingest the content if it is not too distracting. I think the site should be calming and easy to navigate. I am thinking of "spa like" qualities with tranquil colors and soft fonts. I want to give it some accents so that it is clear where each section is located, but mostly I want the design to look fluid and calm. 

Some of the designs I liked and used as inspiration:
